# Grand Army of the Republic
Military Occupation as a Service (MOaaS)

Using Jango Fett's genetic code as a template, Kamino created an army of clone soldiers.

The Grand Army of the Republic, also referred to as the Republic army, was the military force of the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In addition to warships and advanced weaponry, the army consisted of legions of clone troopers—genetically identical soldiers bred to serve the Republic. Although the clone army was originally envisioned by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who secretly commissioned the Kaminoan cloners to create an army for the Republic, the clones ultimately became the secret weapon of the Sith, the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order.

"Yes, a clone army; and I must say, one of the finest we've ever created."
―Lama Su
